# options-alpha-toolkit
A Python tool for ranking options contracts using quant-grade metrics like SAS, TAS, RA-SAS, and Expected Return. Designed for scalpers and swing traders who want to extract alpha using Greeks, volatility edge, and real execution factors. (In progress)
4/25/2025 will release on the 27th. Added more metrics you can put an entire options chain list to view alpha yields. Also added a credit spread option to view spreads of which one is most viable for directionality.
